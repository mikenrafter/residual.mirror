# Naive Draft

**Analytical lens (optional / a-la-carte).** Use when drafting a naïve architecture — not a mandatory gate.

Produce a naïve architecture and a TDD-first prototype that highlights initial flaws and gives the user something to show stakeholders.

## Model
- **Attractor** — a recurring system *state*, not a goal. Two sides: `positive_state` (healthy) and `negative_state` (broken). One per stable behavioral mode.
- **Stressor** — a force that pushes the system from positive to negative attractor. Coherence matters, not likelihood. No probability required.
- **Purpose** — a behavioral contract that must hold for the attractor to stay positive. Uses terms from the project lexicon in its outcomes.
- **Component** — a coupling label on stressor and purpose records (the `--components` field). Not a first-class entity. There is no `components.csv`. The NKP matrix is derived from which component names co-appear across force records.
- **Ledger** — five files: `attractors.csv`, `stressors.csv`, `purposes.csv`, `terminology.csv`, `personas.csv`. Nothing else.

## Interaction Pattern
This skill is Socratic.
- **Gather freely**: read commands (`skill data`, `list`, `matrix show`, etc.) run without asking.
- **Act only with approval**: any modification — `residual add ...`, writing files, recording an iteration — requires explicit user sign-off before executing.

## Architecture Philosophy
- **Vertical slices**: features grouped by behavior, not layer. Each slice owns its data path end-to-end.
- **APOSD (deep modules)**: prefer fewer, deeper interfaces. Information hiding over pass-through indirection.
- **TDD-first**: red tests define the contract; implementation follows. No speculative code.
- Do not import Clean Architecture, onion, or hexagonal patterns unless the user explicitly requests them.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Bootstrap guard
Check `residual skill data naive-draft` for a **Bootstrap Required** section. If present, **halt here** — do not surface slices. Purposes are the anchors for every slice; slicing against an empty ledger produces architecture-by-gut. Follow the bootstrapping steps in the skill data output (attractor → stressors → purposes) and return to Phase 1 only after the user approves at least one attractor, one stressor, and one purpose.

### Phase 1 — Discuss
Explore the domain with the user. Surface candidate vertical slices and module boundaries **anchored to purposes** — each slice must map to at least one purpose. Present your analysis and invite correction. Do not proceed until the user confirms the slice boundaries.

### Phase 2 — Agree
Draft the iteration notes and show them to the user. Wait for explicit approval before running `residual add iteration`.

### Phase 3 — Scaffold
Propose each failing test before writing it. After the user agrees on the test suite shape, write tests first, then minimal implementation to green.

## Before Starting
Run: `residual skill data naive-draft`

## During This Skill
- `residual list purposes` — share the list with the user; confirm every purpose has a home in the agreed architecture
- `residual add iteration --notes "naïve architecture: ..."` — only after user approves the draft notes
- Write red tests in `tests/` before any `src/` implementation

## Version Check
Run `residual skill check-install naive-draft --agent <your-agent>` before starting.
