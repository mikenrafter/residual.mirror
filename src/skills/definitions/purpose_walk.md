# Purpose Walk

**Analytical lens (optional / a-la-carte).** Define purposes when the project needs them — not a mandatory first gate.

Socratically define the project's purposes until every purpose has feature-level precision and at least one verifiable outcome.

## Model
- **Attractor** — a recurring system *state*, not a goal. Two sides: `positive_state` (healthy) and `negative_state` (broken). One per stable behavioral mode.
- **Stressor** — a force that pushes the system from positive to negative attractor. Coherence matters, not likelihood. No probability required.
- **Purpose** — a behavioral contract that must hold for the attractor to stay positive. Uses terms from the project lexicon in its outcomes.
- **Component** — a coupling label on stressor and purpose records (the `--components` field). Not a first-class entity. There is no `components.csv`. The NKP matrix is derived from which component names co-appear across force records.
- **Ledger** — five files: `attractors.csv`, `stressors.csv`, `purposes.csv`, `terminology.csv`, `personas.csv`. Nothing else.

## Interaction Pattern
This skill is Socratic.
- **Gather freely**: read commands (`skill data`, `list`, etc.) run without asking.
- **Act only with approval**: any modification — `residual add purpose`, `add term`, `add attractor` — requires explicit user sign-off before executing.

## Bootstrap Guard
Check `residual skill data purpose-walk` for a **Bootstrap Required** section. If 0 attractors exist, add one before defining purposes — purposes are contracts that keep the system in its attractor; without an attractor the contracts have no target. Propose the attractor to the user and get approval before `residual add attractor`, then return here to build purposes from its positive state.

## Rules
- No probabilities. No risk framing.
- Every purpose must produce at least one outcome: `<subject> <verb> <predicate>` using terms from the project lexicon.
- Push back until vagueness is resolved. A purpose like "the system should be fast" is not a purpose — it is an aspiration. Demand specifics.
- Every 3 turns, step into a critic role and adversarially challenge all stated purposes for hidden assumptions, missing actors, or unmeasurable outcomes.

## Before Starting
Run: `residual skill data purpose-walk`

## During This Skill
- Propose before recording: show the user the full `residual add purpose ...` command and wait for approval before running it.
- `residual add term --term "..." --definition "..."` — propose new terms as they emerge; confirm with the user before adding.
- `residual add attractor --name "..." --positive-state "..." --negative-state "..." --description "..."` — propose attractors; wait for confirmation.
- `residual list purposes` — share the current list with the user periodically to check for gaps or overlaps.

## Version Check
Run `residual skill check-install purpose-walk --agent <your-agent>` before starting.
